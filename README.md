# Spira Mylyn Connector for Eclipse IDE

This plugin lets SpiraTest, SpiraTeam and SpiraPlan (Spira) work with the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
This allows developers to view their requirements, tasks and incidents from Spira directly inside their IDE to simplify development and project management.
Rather than develop a new user-interface from scratch, the SpiraTeam plug-in uses the generic Mylyn task-based interface that allows
Eclipse users to manage their local tasks and tasks from any compatible repository in a single interface.
